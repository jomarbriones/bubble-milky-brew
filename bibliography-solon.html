        My name is Mary Anne P. Solon, and I'm 21 years old. I live in Tondo, Manila, a place that has shaped much of who I am today. <br>
        I come from a small family of five, including myself. I have two amazing sisters and one brother. <br>
        My eldest sister, Mary Jane P. Solon, is 31 years old and happily raising three wonderful kids with her own family. <br>
        My second sister, Shannon S. Tejano, is married to her loving husband, Rudo C. Tejano, and they have a beautiful 9 years old daughter, Roshan S. Tejano. <br>
        Nestor P. Solon Jr, who has been always been supportive. Sadly, my father Nestor B. Solon, passed away in 2022. <br>
        It was a challenging time for us, but my family showed an incredible strength. <br>
        My siblings stepped in to support me financially and emotionally so I could continue pursuing my dreams. <br>
        My mother, Maria P. Solon, a strong and caring woman, remains a constant source of love and guiding in our lives. <br>
        Currently, I am a first-year college student at TUP Manila taking Bachelor of Technological Vocational Teacher Education Major in Electronics Technology. <br>

        During my free time, I enjoy reading books especially wattpad books, watching K-dramas, and spending my quality time together with my family to church. <br>
        Additionally, I like exploring long rides, going to green places that help me unwind. <br>
        I also enjoy running since it comes naturally to me as a former athlete. Dancing is another passion of mine, let's take it a secret, because I'm shy. <br>

        "With God all things are possible" Matthew 19:26 is my favorite quote because it gives me so much hope and strength in life. <br>
        For me, this quote or verse means no matter how hard or impossible something, I can always trust God to help me through it. <br>
        When I think of the challenges I have faced like losing my father in 2022, it reminds me that even during the toughest moments, God's power <br>
        and love are greater than any obstacles. As a college student, I face struggles and uncertainties about my future, <br>
        but this quote reassures me that as long as I do my best and trust in God, anything is possible. <br>

        All my life, I dreamed of becoming a nurse. I wanted to help people and make a difference in their lives by caring for them. <br>
        But as I grew older, my faith and experiences changed my heart, and now I want to become an LPT and a successful person. <br>
        I realized that being a teacher is more than just teaching lessons; it’s about inspiring and helping students grow. <br>
        I want to guide young minds, not just in their studies, but also in believing in themselves and achieving their goals. <br>
        Teaching feels like my calling. It’s a way for me to give back and make a positive impact on others. <br>
        My faith has helped me see that this is the right path for me. <br>
        I know it will take hard work to reach my goal, but I am determined to do my best. Becoming an LPT is my dream now, and <br>
        I am excited to work towards it step by step especially since I have a family who's always proud of me. <br>
